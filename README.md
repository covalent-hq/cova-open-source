# COVA Open Source Wiki

We have compiled and open-sourced 16 of our most critical components. 

These components are instrumental in implementing a TEE blockchain network.

COVA Unity, our enterprise platform, reuses many of these components. And as is the norm with enterprise-grade software, and in order to maintain technological defensibility, we are not ready to open source additional enterprise-grade source code. This policy may well change depending on future circumstances. Please contact enterprise@covalent.ai for more information about COVA Unity.

If you are a public chain developer, please email contact@covalent.ai for more information.
